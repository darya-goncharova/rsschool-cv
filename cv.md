>Hello, my name is Darya, and I'm here to become a true professional in front-end development. I know, that without any programming background it's very difficult to study here, but I'll do my best)
Also, I'm here for the second time. Work, family and many other things intervented me, but now I'm with you until the end.

* HTML, CSS, Basic JS

* All my programming experience is limited to this The Rolling Scopes course.

* I graduated Belarusian State Economic University in marketing. Now I'm working as a procurement specialist in an online shop. But frontend always interested me.

* I have a **B1** English level, according to internet tests. I studied it at school and one year in university. It's easy for me to write or read, but I have a lack of experience in speaking. It's fixable)
Now I'm studying English by myself with a Market Leader course.
